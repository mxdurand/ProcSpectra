# Set of function to process irradiance spectra  
Intended for personal use only and written a long time ago. If you want to use it, expect to have to heavily edit the code yourself.   
You will also have to implement calibration for you own spectrometer.  
Requires [photobiology package](https://github.com/aphalo/photobiology) and dependencies (ooacquire)   

Some markdown are provided to help with setup, and decribe the processing pipeline.
